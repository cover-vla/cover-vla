INSTRUCTION EMBEDDING SIMILARITY vs ACTION ERROR ANALYSIS
============================================================

DATASET OVERVIEW:
Total samples analyzed: 12792
Samples with rephrased instructions: 12792

EMBEDDING SIMILARITY STATISTICS:
Mean similarity: 0.9224
Std deviation: 0.0484
Min similarity: 0.6514
Max similarity: 0.9975
Median similarity: 0.9332

ACTION ERROR (OPENVLA_NRMSE) STATISTICS:
Mean NRMSE: 0.1793
Std deviation: 0.1139
Min NRMSE: 0.0036
Max NRMSE: 0.7874
Median NRMSE: 0.1477

CORRELATION ANALYSIS:
Pearson correlation coefficient: -0.0993
Pearson p-value: 0.0000
Spearman correlation coefficient: -0.1012
Spearman p-value: 0.0000

INTERPRETATION:
✓ SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATION: Higher embedding similarity is associated with LOWER action errors.
  This suggests that when rephrased instructions are more similar to original instructions,
  the model performs better (lower NRMSE).

Correlation strength: 0.099 - Very weak
